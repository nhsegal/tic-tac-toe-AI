Tic-Tac-Toe with the Minimax Algorithm

After coding a working version of tac-tac-toe that utilizes the minimax algorithm, I refactored the code 
to utilize the .forEach() array method for loop over the board. Although it was good practice in terms of 
getting acquired with javascript, I can't help but feel it degraded the readability of the code. My apologies.

When the program's minimax algorithm scores two potential moves as equal, the computer randomly selects one of them. 
This injects a bit of variety in the gameplay while maintaining the computer's competitiveness.
