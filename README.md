Tic-Tac-Toe with the Minimax Algorithm

This project was undertaken in response to [this prompt](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) from the Odin Project. I did not both with creating a form for players to register their names. Instead I focused on developing a version where the computer would be the opponent and would play using a minimax algorithm.

When the program's minimax algorithm scores two potential moves as equal, the computer randomly selects one of them. 
This injects a bit of variety in the gameplay while maintaining the computer's competitiveness. The difference between the 'easy' and 'hard' game modes is the depth of the search that the algorithm undertakes.
